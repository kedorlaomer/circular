# Circular

This program is to be applied in the following (very narrow) use
case:

*   a `source` generates (likely textual) data
-   of which the younger parts are more interesting (as in a log
    file)
*   storing everything is infeasible

In this case, the `source` should be invoked as

    source | circular& pid=$!

When later, some of the `source`'s data is required, ask for it
via

    kill -USR1 $pid

Then `circular` outputs a suffix of the `source`'s data.

Since `circular` uses compression, you will need `libz.a`. This
repository is set up such that `circular` is being linked
statically. If your environment doesn't support this (looking at
you, glibc), then you're out of luck.

## About the implementation

Internally, `circular` stores a compressed circular buffer with
the sources output. It uses `zlib`.
